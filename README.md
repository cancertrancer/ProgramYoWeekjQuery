# ProgramYoWeekjQuery

Heyo, this is my first self-conceived project using a JavaScript framework. It allows you to create daily schedule-checklists for as many days as you like. No need to limit yourself to a week!
Each day is named, starts from the current day.

To use, visit selfparent.net before my free tier of Amazon EC2 service runs out for the month!
No backend, so it's not possible to save your schedule once you've created it, but you can print or screenshot your schedule, or just leave up the window so you can use the checkboxes (although you'll lose all your data if the page refreshes).

Happy planning!
